# Balbix Coding Challenge
---


## Context
---

- The Balbix platform provides customers a comprehensive analysis of their networks and inventory. Balbix maintains a knowledge repo on vulnerabilities that could exist on assets. Information is compiled from a diverse set of resources.
- The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) framework provides a way to identify and standardize various attributes of vulnerabilities affecting systems such as the affected products.
- Affected products are specified by the Common Platform Enumeration (CPE) which is the industry-standard for identifying product attributes.
- Parsers are required to produce output to be easily validated with respect to CPE requirements.

## Objective
---

Given a vendor webpage with vulnerability details, write a program to parse the website and extract all key vulnerability metrics. The program output should be formatted into JSON
